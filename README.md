## Stage 1
The first program should output a square matrix NxN: there must be N lines with N characters in each line. If there is an alive cell, place the letter ‘O’, otherwise, whitespace.

Input data is two numbers in one line. First is N (N>0): the size of the universe. The second is S: a number that you should use as the seed for your Random object.
